    "# Early-life exposure to butterbeer and later-life health consequences\n",
    "This workshop will take you through a synthetic dataset to identify associations between early-life exposure to butterbeer and health in later-life.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Jan 1, 1954, the UK government ended a 10-year long ban on butterbeer. That means that everyone born before Jan 1954 was likely to not be exposed to maternal butterbeer consumption, while those born after Jan 1954 were exposed to maternal butterbeer consumption in utero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cohort you have is a UK Biobank-like cohort. Individuals in this specific one were born between 1952-1955. Participants filled out several questionnaires. You have data on their early life conditions (DOB, where they were born, sex, their income). We also have their medical records and know if they were diagnosed with chronic disease (hypertension and diabetes, for example). In addition, we have blood samples from when they were ~50 years old and have their normalised plasma protein expression levels. We also have some other variables (while may not seem relevant, could be) such as how many car accidents they've been in."
